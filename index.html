  <h1 id="vinylhawk">VinylHawk</h1>
  <p>VinylHawk is a dynamic <b>Vinyl Pricing Engine</b>. We analyse popular marketplaces for your current listings, and use Machine Learning to predict the best prices to help sellers generate more sales.</p>
  <h2 id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
  <p>Being records collectors ourselves, we realized that adjusting prices for hundreds or thousands of items, while keeping track of the supply/demand in the marketplace, and while maximizing your own profit margins is a task that takes time and energy. VinylHawk aims to help you do this. Our algorithms keep track of the supply and demand per item, and offer pricing suggestions in a CSV, so that your items are seen consistently on top of Discogs marketplace listings, ultimately leading to more sales on your records. It&#39;s <b>completely upto you</b> if you decide to adjust prices by uploading the CSV to Discogs or another marketplace of your choice.</p>
  <h2 id="who-we-are">Who We Are</h2>
  <p>We are a small team of data scientists and engineers, who are passionate about Vinyl!</p>
